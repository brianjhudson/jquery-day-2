# Instagram-ish Clone

This site has more content than meets the eye at first. Our task is to make this clone interactive by using jQuery to enable some of the content through user interactions. We'll need click listeners and hover listeners, and we'll need to append elements to the DOM to add pictures.  

You will have to peruse the existing files first. In `index.html`, you'll see the code for the navbar, the add-photos sidebar (which is hidden through an absolute position), and the photo containers. 

In the `styles/style.css` file, you'll see the various styles I've applied to classes. Notice that you can activate many of the views by adding a class of `active` to the containers. Look for this active class to see which elements to target. 

Finally, in `scripts/script.js`, you'll see an empty file with a listener for the DOM content to be loaded. You can use this file to add your event listeners and perform your jQuery operations. 

If I have time, I'll write more detailed instructions below. Good luck!
